# DigitalOcean App

Hi There! Welcome to the GitHub page for the DigitalOcean App. It is built on React Native with a sprinkling of Typescript, and built using Expo's EAS cloud build platform.

## Prerequisites

- MacOS is currently required as I have not debugged the app on Android.
- XCode & XCode Command Line Tools
- Node.js (LTS version recommended by Expo but any version should work)
- Watchman for MacOS and Linux users
- Expo CLI (not required but helpful, `npm i -g expo-cli`)

You can use XCode's built in ios simulator on your mac, or you can install Expo Go on your iphone (from the app store) and scan the QR code that pops up when you run `npm start`.

## Development

`$ git clone https://github.com/jackcrane/digitalocean-app.git`

`$ npm install`

`$ npm start`

I have not done any work to make the app remotely viable on Android (need to do that...), so for now, MacOS is required. More information is availible at https://docs.expo.dev/
